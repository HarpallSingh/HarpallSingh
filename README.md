### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harpall, I'm 29, and I'm a Le Wagon batch #1157 Data Science graduate, currently looking to kick-start my career in Data Science.

To me, data is comparable to the veins and arteries that support the heart - it serves as the lifeline carrying clusters of untapped information waiting to be discovered. The potential impact and value that can be derived from uncharted data fascinates me and fuels my curiosity.

My aspirations are fixated on acquiring a role as an Data Analyst or Data Scientist. Until I achieve this, my focus remains on sharpening my skill set to alongside working on my soft-skills I have gained in the past 10 years of being in work. I am committed to producing exceptional projects and exhibiting my expertise to the world by showcasing them on my GitHub profile.
